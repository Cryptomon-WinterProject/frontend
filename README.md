Welcome to Cryptomon, A fun Pokemon Game.

## Objective

As we hear a lot about blockchain and NFT's in every field, we are implementing the blockchain concept for pokemon game lovers.

## What does it do?

- When a player registers, they receive a set of starter CryptoMons.
- Players can enter a lobby to challenge and battle other online players with their CryptoMons.
- The game algorithm considers the XP(rating) of the CryptoMon, the type of the CryptoMon, adds a small factor of randomness, win/lose Streak of the player and decides the winner of the battle.
- For each battle you win, some Moncoins(Currency to use in battle and shop other's Cryptomons) add to your account.
- If a player loses everything in the battles, But still wants to play, then the player can sell their Cryptomons to others in exchange for Moncoins through the Auction method at Store.- A player can also buy some new crazy Cryptomons from Store.
- A player can also Train their Cryptomons(In which they can increase the XP of the cryptomons at different Moncoins rates) to make them always win cards.
- Player can also buy some crazy Cryptomons from Store.
